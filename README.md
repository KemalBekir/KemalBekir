Hello! My name is Kemal Bekir, and I'm a programming enthusiast based in Maidstone, UK. I've been captivated by technology since a young age and have always been drawn to programming as a way to explore its endless possibilities.

Even though I don't have any professional experience in programming yet, I have dedicated a significant amount of time to learning and practicing different programming languages and technologies. I am always seeking to expand my knowledge and challenge myself with new projects, from developing small web applications to building my own hardware projects.

I'm excited to continue growing as a programmer and look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead. If you have any questions or ideas you'd like to share, don't hesitate to get in touch!
