# Hi there! 👋
My name is Kemal Bekir, and I'm a programming enthusiast based in Maidstone, UK 🇬🇧 originally from Bulgaria 🇧🇬. I've been captivated by technology since a young age and have always been drawn to programming as a way to explore its endless possibilities.

## 👨‍💻 About me

Even though I don't have any professional experience in programming yet, I have dedicated a significant amount of time to learning and practicing different programming languages and technologies. I am always seeking to expand my knowledge and challenge myself with new projects, from developing small web applications to building my own hardware projects.

## 📫 Get in touch

I'm excited to continue growing as a programmer and look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead. If you have any questions or ideas you'd like to share, don't hesitate to get in touch!

Thanks for stopping by! 😊
